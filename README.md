# BorisAI

This repository contains notes for building **Local Lindy** â€“ a fully local AI assistant that can automate tasks on your machine. The plan outlines how to run a small language model locally, integrate it with Python tools, and interact with the operating system.

The project is still in the planning stage. See `plan.md` for the long-form design document and `ACTION_PLAN.md` for a concise checklist of next steps.

## Quick start

After installing [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and pulling a model, you can try the CLI:

```bash
python -m ai_assist plan "organize my screenshots"
```

Or enter a chat session:

```bash
python -m ai_assist chat
```
