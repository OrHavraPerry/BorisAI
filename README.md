# BorisAI

This repository contains notes for building **Local Lindy** â€“ a fully local AI assistant that can automate tasks on your machine. The plan outlines how to run a small language model locally, integrate it with Python tools, and interact with the operating system.

The project is still in the planning stage. See `plan.md` for the long-form design document and `ACTION_PLAN.md` for a concise checklist of next steps.
